The main theory of tea is that there are only 6 types of tea.

백차 - white tea. 백호은침 takes 1 minute 40 seconds for brewing.
녹차 - green tea. Mainly produced in Korea, Japan and Vietnam
청차 - blue tea. Produced in Fujian, which is why Taiwan mainly produces blue tea (historical, cultural influence)
황차 - yellow tea (does not exist anymore)
홍차 - black tea
흑차 - dark tea. Contains microorganisms, can be brewed and drink for 24 hours. Famously known for Puer tea. Discovered by French, this is the tea French people recognize in contrast with British for black tea.

There is a difference between how they are called in Chinese/Korean and English because of the way Eastern and Western culture viewed and classified tea differed. Asian culture identified tea by the color of water the tea leaves produced while the West identified tea by their tea leaves.

When Britain first came to Hong Kong, the tea they first encountered was 기문 홍차, and they labelled this black tea because the tea leaves were black.

기문 홍차 is the base for all black teas such as Earl Grey. If you add herbs or other things on top of the single origin tea, it becomes a blended tea. So UK is known for blended teas, while China remains loyal to its single origin tea.

Drinks have deep relations with empires.

Roman empire left wine.
British and Chinese empire left tea.
America currently rules with coffee.
