On the table, when someone serves you tea
- Tap one finger (index & middle finger) 3 times if they are younger
- Tap two fingers (index & middle finger) 3 times if they are peers
- Tap with whole fist if they are older

It allegedly has its roots in the early Qing Dynasty, when the Qianlong Emperor would regularly travel incognito to observe his subjects. During one of these trips, he found himself in a tea house where he poured himself and then his servant a cup of tea. The servant was unable to ketou to show his gratitude without giving away the Emperor’s disguise, and therefore imitated the same gesture using his fingers.

This gesture is generally used in informal settings to servers pouring tea, and should be done lightly and fairly quickly (the motion is intensified and slowed down in this video). If you’re unsure of the person’s age, use two fingers as a default. Two or three taps are both acceptable, but I usually do three. Predominantly a Cantonese custom, many Northerners nowadays are also aware of this gesture and use it regularly.

Note: if a potential business partner is pouring tea for you, always use two fingers to indicate you are peers. In this instance, it is considered highly disrespectful to use one finger, as it suggests that person is junior to you.
