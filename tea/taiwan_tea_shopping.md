1. Lin Hua Tai Tea

Taipei's oldest tea shop, can get bulk tea leaves for relatively cheap price. You can select quality of tea leaves as well with different price ranges.

2. 有記名茶 WANGTEA ｜ 茶廠 Refinery Tea Factory

I bought a Wen Shan Pouchong teabag set here. Slightly pricier than Lin Hua Tai Tea, but there's wider range of innovative tea products. There's also a tea cafe or bar next door with a variety of tea drinks you won't find anywhere in the world.
