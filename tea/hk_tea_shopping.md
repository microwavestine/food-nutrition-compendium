So let's say you want to buy some tea in Hong Kong and don't know of any place other than the scammy TWG tea. Here are places that I shop at being a hopeless tea addict and all. I'm mostly focusing on older shops here that are more interesting to go visit

1. Fukien tea company in Sheung Wan on Mercer St is an old reliable.  They roast their own teas and the prices are extremely reasonable. I would buy the high roast tieguanyin (鐵觀音 tit3 gun1 yam1) and shuixian (水仙 seui2 sin1) here https://maps.app.goo.gl/13bjyuDUsDmCcLaT6

2. Nearby is Hung Chong Tai, which specializes in pu'er (普洱 pou2 nei2) especially the old HK storage style stuff. Price range from very cheap to a million HKD for a cake of antique tea https://maps.app.goo.gl/sDPxxtLeFLzJDHCL8

3. In between these two is Lam Kie Yuen, more tourist friendly from the looks and maybe better packaging for gifting purposes. More of a generalist store, but also have some interesting pu'er on offer. Rare among older shops in having a working website

4. On QRC there's also Ngan Ki Heung. Also a generalist shop with all kinds of stuff. I was there recently with an out of town friend and had a good time trying some teas with them

5. My friends Connie and Ringo run a shop slightly up the hill on the second floor of Lascar Row Center. Connie's family has been in the tea business for three generations. They press their own pu'er cakes and also have older teas. https://maps.app.goo.gl/1LbZbq43ZenKpKSU8

6. A bit further west in among the dried seafood is Yee On. I like their loose pu'er which is cheap and tasty. They also sell bug poo tea if you know what that is and want to try some. Also has a working website for orders https://yeeonteaco.com
